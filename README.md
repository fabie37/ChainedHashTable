# Hash Table: Chained - C Implementation
Basic C program for a hash table.
By no means use this hashing method. It employs a linked list to deal with collisions.
This is just for me to build a better intuition of data structures developed in low level languages. 

Look at the header file for more information on how each method works. 

If you want to make a hashmap from say an interger to a string, then just add the an extra member to the node structure and revise the search method to return the desired mapping.
